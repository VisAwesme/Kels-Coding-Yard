# CyberDog Sentinel – Master Controller 

Welcome to **CyberDog Sentinel**! 🐾 A highly unhinged but surprisingly effective set of scripts designed to keep watch over your home network, scan for devices, and keep things in check with the occasional rogue device removal (because why not?). All powered by **Python** and **bash**. A must-have for your home network security *if* you're into the whole chaotic-but-functional approach to cybersecurity. 

## Features 🚀

- **Network Scanner**: Scans your local network and identifies devices via `nmap`.  
- **Port Watcher**: Monitors open ports on your system and logs the activity.  
- **Device Logger**: Keeps an eye on the devices connected to your network by logging ARP tables.  
- **Rogue Device Kicker**: Automatically checks for rogue devices and blocks them based on their MAC address. (Because who doesn’t love kicking out unwanted guests?)  
- **Log Everything**: All activity is logged in handy logs so you can sit back and monitor the chaos.

## Requirements 📦

Before using **CyberDog Sentinel**, make sure you have the following installed:

- `Python 3.x`
- `nmap` (for network scanning)
- `ss` (for port monitoring)
- `arp` (for device logging)
- `arptables` (for rogue device blocking)

## Usage ⚙️
