# PowerShell

PowerShell scripts, because sometimes Windows needs a little... encouragement. Here, you'll find:

- Antivirus scripts – Yes, including MEMZ.exe removal.

- Installation scripts – Automate all the things.

- Jokes – Not as funny when they break your system.

⚠️ Disclaimer: If my script bricks your OS, that’s your fault for not reading it first. Not mine.
