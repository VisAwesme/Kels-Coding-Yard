# Shell (SH)

A collection of BASH scripts that may or may not be useful. Expect to find:

- Installation scripts – Because who likes manual setup?

- Unfunny jokes – Yes, including a Rickroll.

- Miscellaneous scripts – I have no idea how to categorize them, but they exist.

Execute at your own risk. Seriously.
