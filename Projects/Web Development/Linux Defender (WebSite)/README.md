# Linux Defender (WEB)

You may be wondering, why am I making this?...

Well kinda just to show off my `HTML`, `JavaScript`, and `CSS` skills, and I kinda wanna make something with a lot of information on it and just not a github download...
As sometimes github *"anti-virus"* downloads can legit just be *"rootkits"* sometimes.

So uhh... yeah! You'll see a lot of progress on this site, hopefully this can inspire you!
