# About

Linux Defender is an experimental security tool designed to help detect and mitigate potential threats on Linux systems. Inspired by Windows Defender, this project is currently in **very early development (v0.1-2, untested)** and should be **used only in virtual machines for now.** I take no responsibility if it decides to go goblin mode on your system.

# Features (Planned & WIP)

- **Basic malware scanning** – Check files for known malicious signatures

- **Process monitoring** – Detect sketchy or high-risk processes running in the background

- **Auto-scan functionality** – Run periodic scans at user-defined intervals

- **Lightweight and efficient** – Designed to work without tanking system performance

- **Logging & reports** – Generate reports on system security status (eventually)

- **Auto-Updating malware signuatures** - Uses a API from *https://bazaar.abuse.ch/api/* for malware signuatures (eventually)

# Contributing

If you want to help, feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or just throw suggestions my way. If you manage to break it in an interesting way, I'd love to hear about it.

# Disclaimer

**This project is in active development and is not ready for real-world use.** Running it on a non-VM system is at your own risk.
