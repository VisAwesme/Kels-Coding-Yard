# Kel's coding-yard
Hello! Welcome to uh, the hell hole called my attempts at scripting (i purposley call my code bad even though it works), you may see some unfinished scripts... if you do please give me any suggestions on how to finish/add onto them!

- All code/scripts are made by Vaughn R (which is me! ^w^).
- Please credit if deciding to reuse my scripts. (Thanks! :3)
